/*
This program implements the guessing game 'Bulls and Cows'.
A sequence of 4 integers in the range 0-9 are selected. The integers do not
repeat. Through guesses and hints a user has to discover the 4 in the correct
order.

How the guess and hints work:
- If the number is 1234 and the guess is 1359 the hint should be '1 bull, 1 cow'
  because the got one digit (1) right and in the right position - the bull. The
  user also got another digit (3) but in the wrong position - the cow.
- Guessing/hints continue until the user gets all 4 numbers in right orider - 4
  bulls.
