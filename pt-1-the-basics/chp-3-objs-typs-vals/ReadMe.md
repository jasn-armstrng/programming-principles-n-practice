# 3. Object, Types, and Values

**_"Fortune favors the prepared mind." - Louis Pasteur_**

This chapter introduces the basics of storing and using data in a program. To do so, we first concentrate on reading in data from the keyboard. After establishing the fundamental notions of objects, types, values, and variables, we introduce several operators and give many examples of use of variables of types **char, int, double, and string**

**Topics covered:**
1. Input (std::cin, std::cout)
2. Variables
3. Input and type
4. Operations and operators (+, *, <=, ++, --, << ...)
5. Assignment and initialization
6. Composite assignment operators (+=, -= ...)
7. Names
8. Types and objects (memory)
9. Type safety
   - Safe conversions
   - Unsafe conversions
