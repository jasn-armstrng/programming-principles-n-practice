/*
  A permutation is an ordered subset of a set. For example, say you wanted to
  pick a combination to a vault. There are 60 possible numbers, and you need
  three different numbers for the combination. There are P(60, 3) permutations
  for the combination, where P is defined by the formula,
              P(a, b) = a!/(a-b)!

  Combinations are similar to permutations except the order of the of the objects
  does not matter. The formula for combinations is,
              C(a, b) = P(a, b)/b!

  Program requirements:
  - Ask user for two integers
  - Ask if to calculate Permutations or Combinations
  - Print the result
  - Check for input errors
  - All erroneous inputs will generate good error messages
