# 6. Writing a Program

**_Programming is understanding." - Kristen Nygaard_**

Writing a program involves gradually refining your ideas of what you want to do and how you want to express it. We will develop a program from a first vague idea through stages of analysis, design, implementation, testing, redesign, and re-implementation. In the process, we discuss program, reorganization, user-defined types, and input processing.
