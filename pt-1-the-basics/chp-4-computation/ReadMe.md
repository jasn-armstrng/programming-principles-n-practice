# 4. Computation

**__If it doesn't have to produce correct results, I can make it arbitrarily fast." - Gerald M. Weinberg__**

This chapter presents the basics of computation. In particular, we discuss how to compute a value from a set of operands (_expression_), how to choose among alternative actions (_selection_), how to repeat a computation for a series of values (_iteration_). We also show how a partcular subcomputation 
can be named and specified separately (_afunction_). Our primary concern is to express computation in ways that lead to correct and well-organized programs.
